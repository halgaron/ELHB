**Boon of Legendary Crafting**

Note: due to collapsing Enhanced domain spells to. Have two abilities, this is now not as useful. Granted this applies to any spell vs just domain spells, so it kinda is ok balance wise. If you stack them you get 2 spell levels which is rediculous. 

**Boon of Epic Dodge**

Prerequisite: Uncanny Dodge class feature, 20 dexterity 
Whenever you use your uncanny dodge class feature, you impose disadvantage on the triggering attack roll. If the attack misses, you can make it target another creature within 5 feet of you.

Designer Notes: This is a very amazing and flavorful solution. OP? maybe but it’s a reaction and a gamble since someone could roll 2 high rolls. Its like a self defense.  As a side note, if the rogue has elusive/blindsense it should stack so it wouldn’t require you to see to gain the benefits of uncanny dodge anymore.

**Boon OF Spell Penetration**

Enemies that are targeted by your spells do not gain the benefit of spell resistance.

Designer Notes; This is a sensitive topic, because there is no + bonus to spells in the game. Granting disadvantage to all abilities is op, +6 DC is insane, but fair, because an epic **Boon = +2 stat or more. You could argue spell penetration is ridiculous since it nullfiies epic advantage which most creatures have anyway. So you could say +3 bonus to DC and attack rolls from that school. Pretty OP, but close. Or you can make it a 1/encounter ability which intensifies but Is stupid. Giving disadvantage is a risk, but ill take it so its roughly on par with spell penetration, since if the creature doesn't have it, or deos have it, the caster can focus in one school and still have the same efforts. And if the creature doesn't have magic resistance even better, but just 1 school.  Note: people think 1/rest = good 
 Aug 26 2020 note: Also since I'm considering putting additional modifications to CR 20+ monsters, the save bonuses will be higher, so this type of escalation might be required or helpful in that regard, since base stats no longer suffice for players or monsters at the high levels. 
May 9th 2021 note: Apparently Tasha's has items that increase attack/dc now. I think the logic still holds here.
